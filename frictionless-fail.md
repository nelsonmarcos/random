Tulerie's co-founder Merri Smith tells me a fascinating story from the company's early days. In the beginning, Smith says, the company invited women to join via a brief Google survey, which it emailed to hundreds of prospective members.

"We wanted to create as little friction as possible, while still having to vet these people," she says.

But only one person filled out the survey. So Smith and her co-founder decided to try a more complicated approach. Anyone who wanted to join had to conduct a brief video call with a company employee first.

Logically, the new strategy should have failed. But it was a huge hit. Prospective members flooded the invite list, filling up the company's interview schedule weeks in advance. By creating a more complex sign-up, Tulerie signalled that its service was special and worth the effort.

"It goes back to values," Smith says. "People perceive it as harder to get into, and they want to be a part of it."
